# Mouse Animations

Animations that respond to cursor position. May behave differently on mobile.

## When to Use Mouse Animations

- Interactive cards/products (tilt effect)
- Parallax depth with cursor
- Hero section interactivity
- Playful/game-like interfaces

## When NOT to Use Mouse Animations

- Accessibility-critical interfaces
- Essential functionality (never rely on mouse for core features)
- Multiple simultaneous effects on many elements
